Contributing
============

Guides for creation of assets can be found [in our documentation](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-modding).

As the files do not create them themselves, unfortunately you have to help out.
grab your favorite program and start creating or improving media files!

Software suggestions:

* [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/): for 2d assets
* [audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/): for audio assets
* [blender](http://www.blender.org/): for 3d assets
