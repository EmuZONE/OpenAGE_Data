==================

This repo contains the free assets for running [openage](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage). They will eventually replace the sprites and sounds used in Age of Empires I, Age of Empires II and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.

Guides for creation of assets can be found [in our documentation](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-modding).
